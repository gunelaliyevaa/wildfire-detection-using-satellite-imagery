# Wildfire Detection in Azerbaijan Using Satellite Imagery

## Project Overview
The **Wildfire Detection in Azerbaijan Using Satellite Imagery** project is a research-focused initiative aimed at developing a reliable model for detecting wildfires across Azerbaijan using satellite data. This project combines techniques from **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to automatically analyze satellite images and identify areas affected by wildfires.

## Project Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can:
- **Analyze satellite images** and identify wildfire occurrences with high accuracy.
- **Build a comprehensive dataset** by creating synthetic images and using data augmentation, addressing the challenge of limited access to high-resolution wildfire images.
- **Provide insights for research** on wildfire patterns and detection methods, contributing to academic studies in environmental monitoring.

The emphasis is on **proof-of-concept** and **research value** rather than real-time or operational deployment.

## Approach and Techniques
This project will use **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, a deep learning model specialized in image recognition tasks. CNNs can identify complex patterns in visual data, making them suitable for detecting unique wildfire features—like smoke, burned areas, and heat indicators—in satellite imagery.

### Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: We will gather satellite images from publicly available sources, such as NASA’s MODIS and VIIRS data, along with ESA’s Sentinel-2 imagery. The dataset will include both real and synthetic images to help the model learn various wildfire scenarios.
2. **Data Processing**: Preprocessing steps, such as cloud masking, will ensure data accuracy. Cloud masking helps filter out areas obscured by clouds, which could otherwise interfere with detecting fire patterns.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Using a pre-trained CNN model, we will fine-tune the model with our dataset of wildfire images. The model will be trained to **detect fire smoke, plumes, and differentiate between smoke and clouds ** in satellite imagery.
4. **Visualization and Analysis**: To make results accessible, we plan to develop a basic visualization tool that allows users to filter images by date, intensity, and location, providing a clear view of wildfire-affected areas.

## Expected Outcomes
The project aims to produce a proof-of-concept wildfire detection model that:
- Accurately detects wildfires in Azerbaijan’s various regions.
- Provides a structured approach for future research and improvements in wildfire detection techniques.
- Demonstrates the potential of satellite imagery and machine learning for environmental monitoring, even with limited resources.
